# Momocs2: Morphometrics methods for outlines, curves, landmarks and measurements

The goal of 'Momocs' is to provide a complete, convenient, reproducible
and open-source toolkit for 2D morphometrics. It includes most common 2D
morphometrics approaches on outlines, open outlines, configurations of
landmarks, traditional morphometrics, and facilities for data
preparation, manipulation and visualization with a consistent grammar
throughout. It allows reproducible, complex morphometrics analyses and
other morphometrics approaches should be easy to plug in, or develop
from, on top of this canvas. Momocs2 is part of MomX and a complete
rewrite of Momocs.
