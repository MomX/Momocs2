\title{Close outline by spreading gap}
\usage{
coo_close_spread(x, ..., .cols = NULL, .ldk_col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix (nx2), list of matrices, or tibble with coo columns.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (reserved for future use).}

\item{.cols}{Column name(s) to process when \code{x} is a tibble. If \code{NULL},
automatically detects columns containing coo columns.}

\item{.ldk_col}{Character. Name of landmark column. If \code{NULL}, uses \code{colname_ldk}.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item If \code{x} is a single matrix: returns the closed matrix
\item If \code{x} is a list: returns a list of closed matrices
\item If \code{x} is a tibble: returns the tibble with closed coo column(s)
}
}
\description{
Distribute the distance between first and last points across all points to close the outline.
}
\details{
For open outlines, distributes the gap between the first and last points
evenly across all points, so the outline becomes closed.

Landmarks are synced to maintain their positions.
