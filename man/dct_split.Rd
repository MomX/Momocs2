\title{Split DCT coefficient vector into components}
\usage{
dct_split(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of DCT coefficients (length must be even).}
}
\value{
List with two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{an}: An coefficients (real parts)
\item \code{bn}: Bn coefficients (imaginary parts)
}
}
\description{
Separate a flattened DCT coefficient vector into its An and Bn components.
}
\examples{
# Create coefficient vector
data(olea)
coefs <- dct(olea$VD[[1]], nb_h = 12)
dct_split(coefs)
