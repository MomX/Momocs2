The goal of Momocs2 is to provide a complete, convenient, reproducible
and open-source toolkit for 2D morphometrics.

Once finished, it will include most common 2D morphometrics approaches
on outlines, curves (aka open outlines), configurations of landmarks,
traditional morphometrics, and facilities for data preparation,
manipulation and visualization with a consistent grammar throughout.

It allows reproducible, complex morphometrics analyses and other
morphometrics approaches. It should be easy to plug in, or develop from,
on top of this canvas.

Momocs2 is part of [MomX ecosystem](https://momx.github.io/) and is a
complete rewrite of [Momocs](https://momx.github.io/Momocs).
