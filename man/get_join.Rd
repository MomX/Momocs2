\title{Join curves into closed outline}
\usage{
get_join(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Curve matrices to join, or a single list of curves.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{coo}: The joined outline matrix (closed)
\item \code{ldk}: Integer vector of landmark indices (join points)
}
}
\description{
Join multiple open curves (positionally) into a single closed outline with
endpoints as landmarks.
}
\details{
Joins curves positionally: the end of curve 1 becomes the start of curve 2, etc.
Join points (shared endpoints) become landmarks and are not duplicated.

The last point of the final curve connects back to the first point of the
first curve to close the outline.
}
\examples{
# Create two curves
cur1 <- matrix(c(0,0, 1,0, 2,1), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
cur2 <- matrix(c(2,1, 2,2, 0,2, 0,0), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)

# Join them
result <- get_join(cur1, cur2)
result$coo  # Closed outline
result$ldk  # Landmark at join point
