The goal of Momocs2 is to rewrite Momocs around tibble, and more generally to make it tidyverse ready. Compared to Momocs, it is really focused on doing morphometrics (manipulating shapes, turning them into coefficients). Others functions that were included in Momocs (eg importing, doing stats, etc.) will move into other MomX packages.

I plan a release to CRAN in late spring 2020. So far, I would prefer to release it as Momocs 2.0 than as Momocs2.

All suggestions, help, etc. are welcome.

## Installation

You can install the released version of Momocs2 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("Momocs2")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
