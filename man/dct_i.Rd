\title{Inverse discrete cosine transform}
\usage{
dct_i(x, nb_h = NULL, nb_pts = 60, ..., .cols = NULL, .name = "_i")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector, list (from raw dct), list of vectors, or
tibble with coe columns.}

\item{nb_h}{Integer. Number of harmonics to use for reconstruction. If \code{NULL},
uses all available harmonics.}

\item{nb_pts}{Integer. Number of points to reconstruct. Default is 60.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (reserved for future use).}

\item{.cols}{Column name(s) to process when \code{x} is a tibble. If \code{NULL},
processes all coe columns automatically.}

\item{.name}{Character. Name suffix for output curve columns when \code{x} is a tibble.
Default is \code{"_i"}. Output columns will be named \code{originalname_i}.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item If \code{x} is a vector or raw list: returns a matrix (nb_pts x 2) with class \code{"xy"}
\item If \code{x} is a list of vectors: returns a list of matrices
\item If \code{x} is a tibble: returns the tibble with new cur column(s) added
}
}
\description{
Reconstruct curve coordinates from discrete cosine transform coefficients.
}
\details{
Performs inverse discrete cosine transform to reconstruct curve coordinates
from coefficients. This is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Visualizing shapes at different harmonic levels
\item Reconstructing shapes from PCA or other statistical analyses
\item Filtering out high-frequency noise by using fewer harmonics
}

If \code{nb_h} is less than the total number of harmonics in the coefficients,
only the first \code{nb_h} harmonics are used (low-pass filtering).

\examples{
# Single curve
data(olea)
cur <- olea$VD[[1]]
coefs <- dct(cur, nb_h = 12)

# Reconstruct with all harmonics
cur_reconstructed <- dct_i(coefs)

# Reconstruct with fewer harmonics (smoothing)
cur_smooth <- dct_i(coefs, nb_h = 6)

# From raw output
coefs_raw <- dct(cur, raw = TRUE)
dct_i(coefs_raw)

\dontrun{
# Tibble workflow
library(dplyr)
olea \%>\%
  dct(.cols = VD) \%>\%
  dct_i()  # Creates VD_coe_i

# Custom column names
olea \%>\%
