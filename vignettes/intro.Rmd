** ONLY SERVES AS NOTEBOOK FOR NOW **


### Morphometrics from the programmer point of view
Morphometrics is the study of shape (co)variation. It essentially consists in mapping shapes into descriptors.

Let's use the following naming conventions: 

* **coo**rdinates serve most often as shapes, but wider matrices such as images are also used;
* **coe**fficients are more suitable variables than allow exploring their inner variability and testing their relations to covariates.
* **cov**ariates, when present, allow to test their relations with coefficients.

Despite different morphometrics flavour, we have:

<center>
```coo + cov -M-> coe + cov```
</center>

In terms of dimensions, for a single shape we can have:  
 * `coo` arbitrary dimensions
 * `coe` can be of arbitrary dimensions
 * `cov` can be absent, or a collection of qualitative and quantitative variables.

### Momocs architecture

### A word on Momocs development history




Momocs2 is a rewrite of Momocs. The main changes are:

* Momocs2 now only deals with core morphometrics operations: typically coo manipulation and morphometrics methods that turn them into coe.
* Importing methods are in Momit, stat methods in Momstats. More generally see MomX. This is a much easier way for me to maintain packages and develop more.
* Coo and Coe classes are now tibble, in other words tidyverse-ready
* Restrictions are alleviated so that additional methods should be easier to add.
* All graphics are ggplot2
* You're not bound to Momocs: you can come, use some of it and return to your preferred environment ðŸ˜„

# coo functions

 * coo_modifyers modify the shapes: return coo_single on coo_single, modify on place coo columns for coo_tbl
 * coo_descriptors describe the shape: return value on coo_single, create new columns on coo_tbl.

You can pass single shapes or list of shapes to all `coo_*` methods. You're not bound to Momocs, you can come, use it and return to your preferred environment.

### Architecture: design and classes

 * Momocs handles shapes that are (or can be turned into) [tibbles](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/). So basically anything with two columns is fine. They are called **coo_single**. They can be collated into **coo_list**, which in turn can be part of a tibble, as a list column. Such tibble have a dedicated class: **coo_tbl**
 * All morphometric methods turn shapes into coefficients. `coo_single`, `coo_list` and `coo_table` are turned into `coe_single`, `coe_list` and `coe_tbl`. `coe_single` have a single row but can have many columns that are morphometrics variables.
 
Side effects of list columns

The number of coo or coe is no longer limited
The shape itself of coo or coe is no longer limited
Adding new morphometric methods resumes to writing method.coo_single, method_i.coo_single
Adding new shapes resumes to writing variations on coo_single

Altogether this makes a huge difference for code readability, maintenance and for future development.
