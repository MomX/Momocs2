Description: The goal of Momocs2 is to provide a complete, convenient, 
       reproducible and open-source toolkit for 2D morphometrics.
       It includes many shape geometric operations and descriptors and 
       define classes around tibbles for collection of shapes.
       Shapes can be outlines, curves, landmarks or measurements. 
       The common 2D morphometrics approaches are available and allow 
       reproducible, complex morphometrics analyses. Other morphometrics approaches 
       should be easy to plug in, or develop from, on top of this canvas.
