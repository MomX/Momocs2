\title{Create a get function with automatic dispatch}
\usage{
make_get_function(impl_fn, fn_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{impl_fn}{Function. The implementation function that operates on a single
matrix (nx2). Should accept \code{x} as first argument and \code{...} for additional args.}

\item{fn_name}{Character. Optional name for debugging (not used functionally).}
}
\value{
A function that dispatches based on input type.
}
\description{
Higher-order function factory that creates get_ functions with automatic
dispatch to handle single matrices, lists of matrices, and tibbles.
}
\details{
The returned function automatically:
\itemize{
\item Applies impl_fn to single matrices and returns the result (as numeric if scalar)
\item Applies impl_fn to each element of a list and returns a list (simplified to
numeric vector if all results are scalars)
\item Applies impl_fn to tibble coo columns and EXTRACTS results (simplified to
numeric vector if all results are scalars)
}

For tibbles, get_* functions extract values for further processing by the user.
They do NOT create new columns or modify the tibble.

Simplification to numeric: If all results are length-1 scalars, the output is
converted from a list to a numeric vector for convenience.

Additional arguments are passed through via \code{...}
